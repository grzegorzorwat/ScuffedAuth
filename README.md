# ScuffedAuth
ScuffedAuth is my learning project based on The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework documentation. It isn't meant to be production ready. I'm writing it as it would be any other businnes application. Where authorization application should be first of all fast and light even at the expense of good practises and readability. Also, I'm using technologies that might not be the best for this case but I just want to learn or practice them. I chosed OAuth because I like its documentation and it's my way to understand and remember it.

# Technologies, libraries and techniques I wanted to learn/practice:
* ASP.NET Core Web API and MVC
* .NET 5.0
* C# 9
* OpenAPI
* TDD with xUnit, nSubstitute, FluentAssertions and dotCover
* Entity Framework Core with MS SQL
* AutoMapper
* Docker with Docker Compose and Docker support for ASP.NET Core projects

# TODO:
* MVC Login page with Microsoft identity
* Separate persistant layer from app
* Clients library
